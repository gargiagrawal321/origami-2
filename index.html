     <b> <i> Camel </i></b> <br>
     <ol>
        <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</li>
        <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
        <li>When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.</li>
        <li>Don’t make a camel angry – they can spit as a way to distract whatever they think is a threat</li>
        <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms.</li></ol>

    <ol>
        <li>A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings – sort of like camouflage. However, this isn’t true.</li>
        <li>Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.</li>
        <li>Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder</li>
        <li>Changing skin color is an important part of communication among chameleons</lI> 
        <li>Host chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches</li>

        <b> <i> teddy-bear </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>The origins of Hug A Bear Day are unclear but it may be connected with the day in November 1902 when Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear on a hunting trip in Mississippi. </li>
            <li> Actually the hunting trip was on November 14, not November 7. </li>
            <li>In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs.</li>
        <li>The official term for a teddy bear collector is an ‘arctophile’.</li>
        <li> The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li>

        <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful origami panda</b></h4>
        <b> <i> Panda </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>
            <li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>
            <li>Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.</li>
            <li>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm – that’s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</li>
            <li>Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it’s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild. That’s why we need to do all we can to protect them!</li>

        <h4><b>Some facts of a  beautiful traditional origami cicada</b></h4>
        <b> <i> Traditional Flying cicada </i></b> <br>
        <ol>
            <li>People call these cicadas “locusts” but they are not true locusts — real locusts look like grasshoppers. The phrase “17 year cicada” indicates that they arrive every 17 years. </li>
            <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
            <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate.</li>
            <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
            <li>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li>
        </ol>
